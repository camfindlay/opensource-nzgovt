# A guide to better Code Sharing on the Common Web Platform

The following guide will set out a series of best practices, many of which have been well tested within the SilverStripe
CMS and wider FOSS communities for years. This section aims to introduce these practices, tools and approaches to public
sector SilverStripe developers working on the CWP that may be new to this open way of working. This is by no means the
only way of working, therefore while going through the process of workflow adoption you may find a need to deviate from
these practices. Learn how those people engaged in the FOSS community go about these processes, and adapt them where a
valid argument can be made to do something differently.
